models: Tag, Photo, Score


routes: Photo (show)
        Tag (create, destroy)
        Score (create)

Build a basic controller and view which contains a photo.

When the user clicks on the photo, it should pop up a "Targeting Box" which surrounds the click area.

There should be a dropdown menu where the user can select from the available characters to associate with that Tag.

When the user selects a character, it should create a Tag associated with that character at that location. Just do this on the front end for now.

When the user hovers over the photo, all current Tags should be visible. When the mouse leaves the photo, Tags should disappear and the photo should look normal.

For now, refreshing the page will reset the photo Tags. That's okay.
